Building and testing can be done using the included Makefile.

To compile the program, run 'make' in the project directory.

To test (and build if necessary) the program, run 'make test' in the project directory. This will execute the command './RoutingSim' which will run 101 tests of 1000 cycles each. Each test is unique in the chance of generating a packet during each cycle in each Packet Generating. Thus, each timestep each Packet Generator will separately choose to inject a packet or not with a chance equal to 1% times the test number (0 - 100). 

Alternately, testing can be done by running './RoutingSim [cycles [chance]]'. This will run a single simulation with the provided number of cycles and the provided chance of packet injection each cycle (0.0 - 1.0).
